Graph is a non linear data structure 
Consists of nodes and edges

Representation:
Three main ways of representation: 
1. set representation: set of edges
2. sequential representation: adjacency matrix, incidence matrix, path matrix
3. linked representation: adjacency list

Algorithms
Traversal: BFS, DFS
